        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p class="p3">Amazon customers utilize digital receipts (Amazon’s Your Orders) to track their purchases, make returns, contact customer service, and provide feedback on their shopping experience. Digital receipts are especially important for Just Walk Out (JWO) customers since they don’t see which items they are being charged for or what their transaction total is before they leave the store. For context, 41% of first-time Amazon Go shoppers interact with digital receipts, and 16% of repeat shoppers engage with receipts. Currently, in Amazon’s Your Orders, there are two separate digital receipt templates for Amazon’s various grocery offerings. One presents the order details and all the items purchased in a single view, while the other has a secondary page listing the items purchased. As Amazon opens new store formats and expands its Just Walk Out technology service to other retailers, it is increasingly important that we answer the following questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What recommendations and best practices for digital receipts can we apply for Amazon’s first-party experiences and share with our third-party partners?</li>
            <li>What Is the optimal way to present the order summary and item details on a digital receipt for JWO?</li>
            <li>Does basket size or store merchandise selection affect the usability of a particular receipt template?</li>
            <li>How might we design a ‘white label receipt template’ that our partners can use as a framework for receipts in their own digital experiences?</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <h4>Embracing The Uncertainty</h4>
        <p class="p3">Throughout my internship, I was constantly faced with ambiguity and was expected to rescope my project based on my team's needs. Even towards the end of my internship, my team had a week of an intense design sprint to refocus and align the project with leadership's feedback. Because there were so many moving parts, I had to adapt to changes quickly, learn to be comfortable with not knowing and to keep an open mind while setting realistic expectations and priorities to push my project forward.</p>
        <h4>Getting and Giving Feedback</h4>
        <p class="p3">One of the most valuable lessons I learned this summer was that getting diverse perspectives on my designs is crucial to revealing blind spots and unlocking possibilities. I participated in weekly design team crits, smaller group feedback sessions, and 1-1's with cross-functional partners to receive and give feedback. As much as I valued getting feedback, everyone on the team was eager to hear my opinions, and I tried to provide thoughtful feedback and think about what direction I can push the team towards.</p>
        <p class="p3">Sometimes when my cross-functional partners provided conflicting feedback it was challenging to find a balance and bring my designs to an agreement, but I learned to understand and empathize with their positions. A product manager might advocate for designs that align more closely with the product road map while an engineer might prefer designs that can be implemented effectively. Understanding different internal goals and trying to bridge the gap was a fun challenge.</p>

      <div class="w-234">
        <p>My summer at Amazon reaffirmed my passion for design. I realized how extremely lucky I was to do something I love as my job and learn from amazing mentors who exemplified the kind of designer and teammate I want to be. Every 1-1 was an opportunity for me to grow professionally and personally, and I will always be grateful for the invaluable lessons and advice I received.</p>
