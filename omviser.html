        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p class="p3">omviser is a platform that connects international students with peer advisers and educational advisers to guide them through college (undergraduate and graduate) admissions processes in the United States. It is a system that gives the students the best opportunity to access higher education through the pairing of an adviser with experience studying in the U.S and their educational process.</p>
        <p class="p3">The platform hopes to empower international students by providing location-agnostic support networks for and during their college admission and application process. The main goal of this project is to design a responsive site that makes mentorship more accessible, irrespective of socioeconomic conditions or geographic boundaries, and provide a platform to coach international students.</p>
        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p class="p3">Understanding users' needs and pain points in the college admissions process for most international students and building a responsive UI through research and design process.</p>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p class="p3">To initiate our research process, we began by conducting a competitive analysis of three primary competitors who target high school students through educational consultancy.</p>
        <h4>Surveys</h4>
      </div>

        <h5>Personas</h5>
        <p class="p3">To really get a feel for the target users, I created personas based on our research to understand their needs, wants, and frustrations.</p>

        <h3>Prototyping </h3>
        <h5>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h5>
        <p class="p3">I began the prototyping process by sketching various concepts for both the home page, blog page, and student step page, email confirmation, and filter pop-up.</p>
        <h5>High-Fidelity Prototype</h5>
        <p class="p3">Through gauging user and team feedback from my low-fidelity designs, I moved towards designing high-fidelity prototypes. By exploring multiple iterations through high-fidelity mockups and employing rapid iterative usability testing measures, my designs were validated directly by user data.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="p3">Although my time at omviser is done, the UI/UX team plans to move forth with this final design iteration and perform usability testing to evaluate user feedback and enhance the platform. Usability testing would include a task-focused plan and would be evaluated using the following metrics to address both usability success and overall product success:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Task Success Rate</li>
            <li>Time Taken Per Task</li>
            <li>Net Promoter Score</li>
            <li>Customer Satisfaction Scale</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p3">Reflecting, this has been a very rich experience, and I've learned a lot about how different forms of research find their way into every stage of the UX process. Thanks for reading!</p>
