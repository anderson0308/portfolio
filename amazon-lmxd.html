        <div class="w-588"> 
          <h6 class="m-0">Today, LMXD Cartographers utilize multiple tools in the map design workflow.  Moreover, the current workflow involves editing in 3P Maputnik, manually generating sprite-sheets in Figma, manually passing a stylesheet and assets between teams in s3, viewing maps in the Stamen viewer, uploading and downloading stylesheets for collaboration, and leaves a lot to be desired for stylesheet management.</h6>
          <h6 class="m-20">For LMXD Cartographers, having a fully in-house map design tool is critical, as there is friction, limitations, and inefficiencies in the design workflow. We believe this single tool, SUMMER, will act primarily as a cartography tool for design, a stylesheet viewer for QA, and a stylesheet manager to reduce friction when passing between teams.</h6>
          <h3 class="m-40">main goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce the use of individual helper tools by proving a single tool that acts primarly as cartography tool for style design, style review, and style mangement</li>
            <li>Provides a range of features to allow users to design the best intuitive visual map experiences</li>

        </div>

        <div class="w-588"> 
          <h3 class="m-0">seek diverse perspectives</h3>
          <h6>I came to understand how easily designers may become connected and unintentionally become defensive when confronted with negative feedback. However, it was clear how much more and faster I developed after carefully hearing opposing viewpoints even further 
            and proactively pursuing the causes and mechanisms of other people's thought processes. Early on, this really struck a chord with me, and I'll be carrying this wise counsel with me as I return to school, work on future side projects, and especially in my interpersonal connections.</h6>
          <h3>story telling is essential</h3>
          <h6>Along with growing as a designer, I also discovered the value of seeing beyond the pixels since they are timeless and universal. Because of this, it's crucial to take into account the implications of the pixels we design when designing.
            I gained knowledge about the use of narrative to define an issue, convey the context of a product's use, and aid in execution at Amazon.</h6>
          <h3>embrace the uncertainty</h3>
          <h6>I entered it with the assumption that I would only be honing my art, but I also found opportunities to hone my soft skills, such as leadership, communication, and self-assurance. I had to take charge of 
            promoting a point of view, facilitating debates, and updating stakeholders. Moreover, as I started to understand the problem, I realized that cartography is a hard discipline and an area I have not had much exposure. I had to embrace the difficulty of the problem space and I constantly asked questions and  seeked resources to overcome the roadblocks.</h6>
