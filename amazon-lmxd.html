        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <h6>I conceived the idea for, designed, and executed a cartography design tool for stylesheet design, stylesheet visualization, and stylesheet management. Developed and iterated a web-based prototype and presented concept and UX processes to partner teams and Geospatial product managers.</h6>

    <!--Project Project Overview-->
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <h6>The LMUX Cartographers have identified tooling needs for a more effective and productive workflow. The following are the
        primary categories that currently use individual helper tools. We define individual as in these tools are independent from each
        other and cannot affect changes to other tools.
      </h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Data Curation</li>
        <li>Styling</li>
        <li>Style Management</li>
        <li>Style Review (Design)</li>
        <li>Testing (Engineering)</li>
      </ol>
      <h6>Moreover, the current workflow involves editing in 3P Maputnik, manually generating sprite-sheets in Figma, manually passing
        a stylesheet and assets between teams in s3, viewing maps in the Stamen viewer, uploading and downloading stylesheets for
        collaboration, and leaves a lot to be desired for stylesheet management. Ideally, the cartographers are looking to combine the
        tools and add the more features for a more comprehensive review process. Having a fully in-house map design tool is critical,
        as there is friction, limitations, and inefficiencies in the design workflow. The team believes this single tool, SUMMER, will act primarily
        as a cartography tool for design, a stylesheet viewer for QA, and a stylesheet manager to reduce friction when passing
        between teams.</h6>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <div class="quote-card lmx m-40">
          <p>
            How might we reduce a suite of tools into a single streamline map design process with the most useful and Amazon-relevant features in one ecosystem, where users can deliver the best intuitive visual map experiences.  
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>Unfortunately, I can't get into any more detail about the work I did at Amazon, as it is under NDA.</h6>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
      <h3>Seek Diverse Perspectives</h3>
      <h6>I came to understand how easily designers may become connected and unintentionally become defensive when confronted with negative feedback. However, it was clear how much more and faster I developed after carefully hearing opposing viewpoints even further 
      and proactively pursuing the causes and mechanisms of other people's thought processes. Early on, this really struck a chord with me, and I'll be carrying this wise counsel with me as I return to school, work on future side projects, and especially in my interpersonal connections.</h6>
      <h3>Story Telling is Essential</h3>
      <h6>Along with growing as a designer, I also discovered the value of seeing beyond the pixels since they are timeless and universal. Because of this, it's crucial to take into account the implications of the pixels we design when designing.
      I gained knowledge about the use of narrative to define an issue, convey the context of a product's use, and aid in execution at Amazon.</h6>
      <h3>Embrace the Uncertainty</h3>
      <h6> I entered it with the assumption that I would only be honing my art, but I also found opportunities to hone my soft skills, such as leadership, communication, and self-assurance. I had to take charge of 
      promoting a point of view, facilitating debates, and updating stakeholders. Moreover, As I started to understand the problem, I realized that cartography is a hard discipline and an area I have not had much exposure. I had to embrace the difficulty of the problem space and constantly asking questions and resources to overcome the roadblocks. </h6>
