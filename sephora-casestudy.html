                <h3>A Glow on the Blind Spot</h3>
                <p>“THAT’S IT! I’ve had enough! If this doesn’t work, nothing will.” How many times has that been the mantra playing in your head? You’ve tried the products, watched YouTube videos, read articles and reviews, yet you’re still not satisfied with how your skin looks. These products and methods are seemingly working for everyone else, why not you? And it only leaves you wondering if it is your skin? Am I using the right products? Maybe I’m using too much or too little of a particular treatment.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>What once seemed as a simple face wash is not a multi-step skincare process that is unique to its users with different steps and products.</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Sephora's mobile app today allows users to find skincare products by having buying guides based on skincare ingredients and age or taking skincare quizzes based on skin concerns or products. However, unless users are talking face-to-face with a professional to help guide them, taking a questionnaire about their skin requires a certain degree of beauty know-how.<strong> People want to personalize the perfect skincare routine to achieve healthy and fresh skin, but they can’t do these well because:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>They lack skin care knowledge</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>There's a wide range of skincare products with different functions</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>They don't know what type od help their skin needs</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>To better understand skincare users' needs and key pain points with creating effective skincare routine, I dove into interviews with other skin care users.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Becoming a Skincare Expert</h3>
                <p>My objective was to recognize the key pain points associated with consumers creating their skincare regime. Based on my objective, I want to identify three things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What users routinely do to narroe down to specific skincare products</li>
                    <li>How users understand what issues their skin is undergoing</li>
                    <li>What steps do users have in their skin care routine</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>User Research</h4>
                <p><strong>Skin Care Junkie</strong> - These users are skincare addicts obsessed over everything skincare related. They are knowledgeable about their skin type, the products they use, and what areas in their skin need improvement. The true value of a well-made skincare regime is important to them, and they understand that their relationship with skincare is a uniquely personal journey. They are always looking for the <strong>opportunity to improve and update their skincare routine to best suit their skin needs.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Face Wash Aficionado</strong> - Some consumers care about their skin but only use face wash as their skincare routine. Of the users I talk to, half use a proper face wash to cleanse their skin. The other half uses bath wash, hand soap, or only water to wash their face. These users provided an interesting perspective because they <strong>make at least one or more common mistakes when cleansing their face.</strong> These users want to maintain healthy skin, but lack proper awareness and habits for skincare.</p>

                <p><strong>I-Tried-It-All User</strong> - I recognized that these users have had their pity party because of their skincare journey. These users are <strong>self-conscious of their face and are overwhelmed and tired with their skincare journey.</strong> They are tired of getting excited by gleaming promises from new products, friends’ recommendations, and Youtube videos. They have tried it all, and almost any product you can think of it is probably on their bathroom shelf. These users have come to terms that nothing will change for their skin.</p>

                <h4>Know Your Skin Concerns</h4>
                <p>Users want to develop a proper skin care routine, but the process can be overwhelming and difficult for many. Many users know about the different types of skincare products and their purpose. <strong>The real problem is that users didn’t know their specific skin concerns and their common behavior mistakes when maintaining their skin.</strong> This blind spot in a lot of consumers’ knowledge and habits has had a measurable impact on the overall wellbeing of their skin--often with poor, little, or no results. It is common for users to mischaracterize their skin and not give any thought to it. Users know they want their skin to look better.</p>
                <p>To dig deeper into users' skin concerns and find a way to perfect their skincare routine, I grabbed some sticky notes and decided to brainstorm. </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Finding the Perfect Formula</h3>
                <p>To motivate the brainstorm session, I rephrased the people problem as two open-ended questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How might we incetivize users to follow less behavioral mistakes in their skincare regime</li>
                    <li>How might we helps users find and understand their skin concerns</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When evaluating the potential solutions, I reminded myself of the one keyword in the people problem:</p>
                <p>1.<strong>Personalize</strong></p>
                <p>The approach to skincare is not one-size-fits-all by any means, so it makes sense that the idea of customized skincare is resonating with a lot of users. For users selecting products for their skincare routine is an individual experience that many drained off. There’s a range of factors that need to be taken into consideration when creating a skincare routine: User’s skin type, tones, texture, concerns, and goals. One user makes look for a facial moisturizer to help stave off fine lines, while another needs to use one that boots hydrations. Great skincare is about users using the right products for their skin. Every user must be using the ideal products made precisely to their skin needs. The effective solution should focus on narrowing product choices that fit best for each users’ skin needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Research--How other retail brands help users to find skin care products</strong></p>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Ardensa Cartajona -->
                <img src="images/sephoramarket.png" alt="Market Research"/>
                <p>Ulta shows users the purpose of each skincare step and shows who should use each product </p>
                <p>Neutrogena scans its users face and provides scores on dark circles, dark spots, fine lines, smoothness, and wrinkles</p>
                <p>Beauty Bay sorts out all of their skincare products by the different types of products</p>
                <p>La Roche-Posay allows users to shop by the different types of skin: oily, dry, sensitive, and other types </p>
                <h4>Choosing a Skincare Product</h4>
                <p><strong>Skin Analyzer.</strong> In this feature, users' faces would get scanned and analyzed to get results on different aspects of their skin. Based on their results, users would get product recommendations to help them reach a healthier skin, and they would get suggestions for each skincare step as well.</p>
                <p><strong>Feasibility</strong>: High/Medium</p>
                <p>Sephora is familiar with Artificial Intelligence since it is used on some of their mobile application features. It has a ‘Virtual Artist’ feature that allows its users to virtually play around with the different make-up products they have to offer. Because of this, it would be feasible for Sephora to create another feature with Artificial Intelligence to scan users' skin and determine their skin concern.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact</strong>: High</p>
                <p>The problem with the current skincare quiz feature is that a lot of users don’t know their skin concerns or skin type. This makes it difficult for users to accurately find the right and necessary product for their skin. The skin analyzer feature would be impactul because users would get results on their skin and recommended products that fit their skin needs.</p>

                <img src="images/sephora-feasibility.png" alt="Feasibility Chart">
                <p>After the comprehensive evaluation, I decided to go with the Skin Analyzer feature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It combines the best of both worlds--impact and feasibility</li>
                    <li>It naturally carries the helpful and advance service of Sephora</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Creating a Skincare Routine</h3>
                <h4>Initial Desing</h4>
                <p>It was important to find the right balance of visibility and usability. The entry point had to be visible to the users while not interfering with other purposes of the app. After navigating through the app, I decided to test the entry point from the Home, Shop, and Inspire Screen.</p>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Ardensa Cartajona -->
                <img src="images/sephora-initialpoint.png" alt="Initial Point Explorations"/>
                <p>A. Feature on the Home Page</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: Helps create some familiarity with the feature since it would be in the front of the page</li>
                    <li>CON: Not the most conventional location, since it is temporarily used to promote products and new campings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>B. Feature on the Shop Page</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: Users shopping for skincare products are more likely to use the feature</li>
                    <li>CON: Browse through the skincare segment first and then navigate to a new page to find the feature</li>
                </ul>
                <p>C. Feature on the Inspire Page</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: Placement fits best with Sephora’s current design and layout for features on the app</li>
                    <li>CON: Less visible from the other explorations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After some critiques and feedback, I decided to go with exploration <strong>C</strong>. Not only is the feature in the Inspire page consistent with the app’s current app, but users can easily navigate to it on the page. In my user testing, I recognized that users went directly to the Inspire page to find all the features on the Sephora app. It became clear that users understood the layout and flow of the app. </p>
                <h4>Results Page</h4>
                <p>Going back to the people problem, I wanted to make sure that the Result page was insightful enough to help users understand their skin concerns without overwhelming them. With that in mind, I explored different layouts to see which one best displayed the results.</p>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Ardensa Cartajona -->
                <img src="images/sephora-resultspage.png" alt="Results Page Explorations"/>
                <p>During my user testing, I realized that it was important for users to navigate through the results effortlessly. I had neglected to consider a balance between the arrangement of the stats and user usability. That being said, I pursued iteration <strong>C</strong> because users felt it the easiest to navigate through, and it had enough space to display information.</p>
                <p>Although design C had the right amount of screen to show the result while being user friendly, it was visually inconsistent with the app. Visually, the page did not feel appropriate with the overall design of the app. Also, in my original designs for the Result screen, I hadn’t thought of what type of results were going to be displayed. Sephora’s skincare quizzes have a long list of skin concerns. To simplify and help users understand their skin concerns better, I decided not to use all of them. Instead, I chose more general facial features to show the user’s overall skin condition that overlapped skin concerns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oil Levels</li>
                    <li>Acne</li>
                    <li>Pores</li>
                    <li>Texture</li>
                    <li>Pigmentation</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Ardensa Cartajona -->
                <img src="images/sephora-visualexp.png" alt="Visual Explorations"/>
                <p>I decided to go with design <strong>B</strong>. Users indicated that the size of the circle in iteration A and C was too big and did not balance as well with the size of the font like in design B. Additionally, everything in the center is more visually appealing.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                <p>I created a UI Kit as a comprehensive resource to allow me to maintain consistency and streamline my design process for all my exploration. With the assortment of the kit, I was able to dive deeper into the visual treatment of my high-fidelity prototype. Additionally, the UI Kit helped me plan my campaign and prototype design’s structure properly and as a whole.</p>

                <img src="images/sephora-uikit.png" alt="Sephora UI Kit"/>
                <h4>Final User Flow</h4>
                <p><strong>Initial Page.</strong> In this view, users are going to be able to access the Skin Analyzer feature through the ‘Inspire” page. Originally, Sephora had a subcategory on that page called ‘Virtual Artist.’ Because the Skin Analyzer is an AI feature, I placed under there and changed the name of the subcategory to ‘Virtual Experiences.’</p>
                <p><strong>Skin Analysis.</strong> In the Skin Analysis page, users place their face on the screen and get their faced scan. In this screen, the users have to wait as well as the app to analyze and get their results.</p>
                <p><strong>Results.</strong> Users are going to get a percentage out of 100% to determine their levels on different facial features: Oil levels, Acne, Pores, Texture, and Pigmentation. The overall level of the score is going to be displayed to show if it is bad or good. Additionally, if users use the feature previously, they are going to see their average percentage and if it is the difference between the last time they used it.</p>
                <p><strong>Recommendations.</strong> Based on their results, the feature would formalize an entire skincare routine with different products in each step to best-fit users’ preferences and price points. Depending on their score, users would get on average 3-5 product recommendations per step.</p>
                <h4>Final Flow from Initial Point to Face Scanning</h4>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Ardensa Cartajona -->
                <img src="images/sephora-final1.png" alt="Final Prototype Part 1"/>
                <p>The final flow allows users to use the Skin Analyzer feature from the Inspire page. From there, users have to press start. Their face gets scanned, and then it gets analyzed.</p>
                <h4>Final Flow from Results to Recommendations</h4>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Ardensa Cartajona -->
                <img src="images/sephora-final2.png" alt="FInal Prototype Part 2"/>
                <p>The final flow allows users to see their results after their face gets scanned. Additionally, if the user doesn’t understand the score, they get details about it. Lastly, the user would have product recommendations.</p>
                <p>I created a prototype to showcase my interactions with the flow and how users could realistically use the app.</p>
                <h4>We Belong To Something Beautiful</h4>
                <p class="first">This solution holds the Belong Campaign Manifesto at its core and takes design inspiration from Sephora’s branding. It is important to remind consumers of their beauty through a healthy, glowing skin journey that allows them to <strong>blossom like a flower</strong>. It embodies the fearlessness of unrestricted self-confidence and inspires consumers to be their most natural selves.</p>
