                <h3>Nice to meet you!</h3>
                <p>I'm Ardensa Cartajona a Houston native who is enthusiastic to solve problems and design beautiful, intuitive experiences that make an impact. Currently, I am a junior at Cornell University studying Information Science with a concetrations in User Experience, along with minors in Business and Communication.This summer I had the opportunity to intern at omviser as a UX/UI designer.
                </p>

                <p>Design is something I have been passionate about since I was young. My interest for design grew in high school when I self-taught graphic design--which later influence me to follow product design. In Spring 2020, I decided to take Intro to Product Design, a course at Cornell, where I fell in love with the entire experience: from product thinkng to interaction and visual design. Since the course, Iâ€™ve had opportunities to design human-centered experiences for digital products.</p>

                <p>I'm passionate about serving people by solving for their needs and undersntading the gravity of those decisions as they impact the world. I strive for an opportunity to use creativy and tech innovation to design the future of those who need it.</p>

                <p> When I'm not heads down with designs, you can find me running, binge-watching Netflix shows, creating new Spotify playlists, or drinking tea with family or friends.<p>
